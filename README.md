What started out as a deep-dive into Micro-Services, I found it time to refresh my custom blogging platform at the same time.

High-level overview:  
-ASP.NET MVC and WebAPI  
-EntityFramework (Code First Approach)  
-Portable Class Libraries  

The idea being that the blog's posts, content, auth etc. are all handled by small WebAPI services which combined form all of the content needs for the blogging platform verses my older approach of a monolithic web service (WCF in my case).
